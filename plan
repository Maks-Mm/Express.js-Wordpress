Ah, now I understand exactly what you’re asking — you’re seeing dates appear in your React frontend, but you never actually inserted any date in MongoDB, because your collection is basically empty except for placeholder/example items. Let’s clarify how the **dates are being set and sent** to the frontend.

---

### 1️⃣ WordPress posts

For WordPress posts, the date comes from WordPress itself:

```ts
const posts = postsResponse.data.map(post => ({
  ...post,
  type: "wp",
  id: `wp-${post.id}`,
}));
```

* `post.date` is provided by WordPress.
* The frontend displays it here:

```ts
{new Date(item.date).toLocaleDateString("en-US", { ... })}
```

So WordPress is the source of the date for the `wp` items.

### 2️⃣ Static Dortmund news (`/api/news`)

In your backend, you had this:

```js
const dortmundNews = [
  {
    id: "news-1",
    title: "Dortmund City Development News",
    link: "...",
    description: "...",
    date: new Date().toISOString(),
    source: "Stadt Dortmund",
    type: "news"
  },
  ...
];
```

Notice:

```js
date: new Date().toISOString()
```

* These dates are **generated at runtime** when your server responds.
* That means every time you restart your backend or fetch `/api/news`, it creates new dates for these items, even though there’s no real date in a database.
* They are “fake” dates for demo purposes.

### 3️⃣ MongoDB news items

When you fetch MongoDB items in `/api/content`:

```js
const mongoFormatted = mongoNews.map((item) => ({
  ...item,
  id: `mongo-${item._id}`,
  title: { rendered: item.title },
  excerpt: { rendered: item.description || item.content?.slice(0, 150) || "" },
  content: { rendered: item.content || item.description || "" },
  date: item.date || new Date().toISOString(),
  source: item.source || "MongoDB Feed",
  type: "news",
}));
```

* `date: item.date || new Date().toISOString()`

Here’s the key:

1. If your MongoDB document **has a `date` field**, it will use that.
2. If your MongoDB document **does not have a date**, it will automatically generate `new Date().toISOString()` — i.e., the current timestamp.

This is why your frontend sees dates even though your cluster has no real “news” with dates.

### 4️⃣ Sending dates to the client

* The backend sends the combined array via `/api/content`.
* Each item has a `date` field.
* Your React component uses:

```ts
{new Date(item.date).toLocaleDateString("en-US", { ... })}
```

So the **client page is just displaying whatever `date` the backend sends**, regardless of its origin.

### ✅ Summary

| Source          | Where the date comes from                           |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| WordPress posts | WordPress API (`post.date`)                         |
| Static news     | Generated dynamically with `new Date()`             |
| MongoDB news    | `item.date` in MongoDB if exists, else `new Date()` |

---

### 🔹 Next Steps

If you want **real dates for MongoDB news**:

1. Add a `date` field when you insert items in MongoDB.
   Example:

```js
await News.create({
  title: "Some news",
  description: "Description",
  content: "Content",
  link: "...",
  source: "News Source",
  date: new Date("2025-11-01T10:00:00Z")
});
```

2. Or, if you’re scraping from a real source, extract the publication date and store it in the MongoDB document.

I can also show a **quick MongoDB insertion script** for your existing cluster where you can add multiple news items with proper dates so your frontend will display realistic news.

Do you want me to do that?
